There is no need to worry or get it investigated. But still if you feel worried you may discuss it ￼￼in the group call or with your HCW. It usually resolves once you stop breastfeeding.\n\n● But on the other hand it is important to know that you can still get pregnant if your periods have not started yet. If you feel you might be pregnant, take a urine pregnancy test (UPT) yourself as soon as possible.\n\n● The breast might appear full and increased in size compared to pre-pregnancy. This is again a good sign of adequate milk production and normalises once you stop. At times your breast may feel soft or not full of milk, but this does not mean that your breast does not have milk, this is normal. Do not stop breastfeeding or start integrating any other foods or liquids. Exclusive breast feeding is best for your baby till 6 months old.",
