# DEP_PreNatal

As a part of my development engineering project I worked in close cordination with the doctors of PGI Chandigarh to develop a cross platform application that provides necessary support to women in their pre and post natal stages.
Available in English , Hindi and Punjabi ,the app caters to a large variety of audience.<br />
Some of the app's salient features include :
- Secure OTP based login using firebase
- Week wise reading content suggestion
- Weekly exercise recommendation with auditory cues and visuals
- Reminders for upcoming appointments and vaccinations
- All your doctors listed with their available time slots and chat/call feature from the app

A separate tools sections provides with the following features that helps the doctor to diagnose you better :
- Fetal Count
- Contraction Timer
- Sleep Tracker
- Hydration Tracker
- BMI Calculator
- Weight Tracker

To sum it up this app is the one stop destination for all mothers in their pre/post natal stages.
The apk of the application is available here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/14jUIc9xk938Z1jQ8SboZYEejX9PAz-Cv/view
